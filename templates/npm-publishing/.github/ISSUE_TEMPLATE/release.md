## Release a new version of a package

This issue will trigger a new release for a specific package. Please edit the title of this issue to specify the package and the type of release.

### Instructions

1.  **Replace `<package-name>`** in the title with the full name of the package you want to release (e.g., `ai-router`).
2.  **(Optional) Specify the release type.** You can specify `major`, `minor`, or `patch` after the package name. If you don't specify a type, it will default to a `patch` release.
