## Welcome to the Future of AI Agents

Microfox is building the next generation platform for AI agent development, deployment, and discovery. While we're still crafting the perfect experience, here's a glimpse of what's coming.

## What We're Building

Microfox will be a comprehensive ecosystem that includes:

- **Micro SDKs**: Byte-sized integrations for every API and service
- **X Framework**: A unified framework for building powerful AI agents
- **Decentralized Store**: A marketplace for discovering and sharing agents
- **One-Click Deployment**: Deploy agents to custom subdomains instantly
- **Agent-to-Agent Communication**: Seamless collaboration between agents
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Built-in interfaces for human oversight

## How It Will Work

### 1. Instant Agent Creation

```bash
# Coming soon - one command to create a fully functional agent
npx microfox@latest kickstart
```

### 2. Custom Subdomain Deployment

Every agent gets its own subdomain for instant access:

- **slackd.microfox.app** - A Slack integration agent
- **reddit.microfox.app** - A Reddit monitoring and engagement agent
- **sparkboard.microfox.app** - A creative brainstorming agent

You can also choose to deploy it to your own domain with some minor DNS setups.

### 3. Micro SDK Integration

```typescript
// Coming soon - seamless integration with any service
import { Slack, Reddit, OpenAI } from '@microfox/micro-sdks';

// One line to add powerful capabilities
agent.addTool(new Slack({ token: process.env.SLACK_TOKEN }));
agent.addTool(new Reddit({ clientId: process.env.REDDIT_CLIENT_ID }));
```

## Real-World Examples

## The Vision

- **Zero Configuration**: Deploy agents with minimal setup
- **Micro SDKs**: Pre-Built + Build on Demand
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support across the ecosystem
- **Agent Reuse**: All agent developed through X Framework are interusable & communicable
- **Custom Subdomains**: Your brand, your agent
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Track usage and performance
- **Agent Store**: Discover and share agents
- **Scalable Monetization**: Monetize & Sale based on demand & use
- **Templates**: Pre-built agents & sdks for common use cases
- **Collaboration**: Build agents together
- **Monetization**: Earn from your agent contributions
- **Open Source**: Transparent and community-driven
