Ai-Router is a framework for **orchestrating structured, multi-agent AI systems**. Heavily inspired by the simplicity and power of [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) & Agent as Tool approach of Google's [Agent Development kit Adk](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/).

## The Problem: Why AI Router is needed

Modern AI applications, especially those using helpers like the Vercel AI SDK's `useChat`, typically connect the frontend to a single backend API endpoint. This creates a significant challenge: how do you manage a complex, multi-agent system through that single route?

```typescript
// Your frontend connects to ONE endpoint
const { messages, append } = useChat({
  api: '/api/chat', // Single endpoint for everything
});
```

Cramming an entire agentic orchestration logic—with multiple specialized agents, tools, and state management—into a single function is complex, hard to maintain, and quickly becomes unmanageable.

```typescript
// The nightmare: Everything in one function
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { messages, agentType, workflow, context, tools, state } =
    await request.json();

  // 1000+ lines of conditional logic
  if (agentType === 'code-generator') {
    // Code generation logic
    if (needsValidation) {
      // Validation logic
      if (needsHumanApproval) {
        // Human-in-the-loop logic
      }
    }
  } else if (agentType === 'data-analyzer') {
    // Data analysis logic
  } else if (agentType === 'content-writer') {
    // Content writing logic
  }
  // ... endless conditionals
}
```

## The Solution: AI Router

`ai-router` solves this with the **Principle of Singularity**. It allows you to build a sophisticated web of agents, middleware, and tools, each with its own path, and then serve the entire system through a single handler.

The routing is handled internally, using path-like parameters sent in the request body, which simplifies both frontend and backend architecture.

Your frontend communicates with one endpoint, while your backend remains modular, organized, and scalable.

### Core Design Principles

`ai-router` brings a familiar middleware-style architecture to the world of AI assistants. It provides a robust foundation for orchestrating complex AI workflows with multiple agents, tools, and dynamic routing, all while integrating seamlessly with the [Vercel AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/introduction).

#### 1. **Principle of Singularity**

Your frontend connects to one endpoint, but your backend is modular and organized:

```typescript
// Frontend: Still one endpoint
const { messages, append } = useChat({
  api: '/api/chat',
});

// Backend: Clean, modular agents & routing logic
router.agent('/code-generator', codeGeneratorHandler);
router.agent('/data-analyzer', dataAnalyzerHandler);
router.agent('/content-writer', contentWriterHandler);
```

#### 2. **Express.js Familiarity**

If you know Express.js, you already know AI Router:

```typescript
// Express.js style routing
router.use('*', authMiddleware);
router.agent('/users/:id', userAgent);
router.tool('/search', searchTool);
```

#### 3. **ADK Inspiration**

Agents can be attached as tools to LLM calls, enabling agent sub-agent architecture similar to Google's Agent Development Kit:

```typescript
router.agent('/blog-writer', async ctx => {
  const { topic } = ctx.request.params;
  const { text } = await generateText({
    model: openai('gpt-4'),
    prompt: `Write a blog post about ${topic}.`,
    tools: {
      // Attach the existing agent as a tool for the LLM to use
      researcher: ctx.next.agentAsTool('/research'),
    },
  });
  ctx.response.write({ type: 'text', text });
});
```

#### 4. **Full-Stack First**

Built specifically for modern web applications:

- **TypeScript native**: Full type safety
- **Next.js optimized**: Works seamlessly with App Router
- **AI SDK integration**: Designed for `useChat` and similar patterns
- **Streaming support**: Native streaming support
