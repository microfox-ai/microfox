AI Studio is a powerful, comprehensive development platform designed to accelerate the creation and iteration of AI Router applications. It provides developers with a complete toolkit for building, testing, and optimizing multi-agent AI systems with advanced visualization, automation, and testing capabilities.

## **Quick Start with Simple Commands**

AI Studio can be configured with a single kickstart command, making it incredibly easy to get started:

```bash
npx microfox@latest kickstart
# chose Yes when asked to install Ai Studio
```

### **Pre-built React Components & Componenet Map**

As you will observe in the example project, you can easily customise and configure your own componenets inside the chat,
with just attaching them at `components/ai/index.tsx` folder.

```typescript
// components/ai/index.tsx
export const aiComponentMap = {
  agents1: {
    full: Agent1Component,
    footer_sticky: Agent1Footer,
    header_sticky: Agent1Header,
  },
};
```

The following are the currrently supported:

<CodeGroup>
```bash component-types
- input: replaces the input box in the step.
- output: replaces the output box in the step.
- full: replaces the entire step component.
- header: replaces the header of the step.
- header_sticky: replaces the header of the step making it sticky to the next step.
- footer: replaces the footer of the step.
- footer_sticky: replaces the footer of the step.
```

```bash hooks
- useLayout: to collapse and expand the left and right side panels, replace right-side componenets.
- useAppSession: to get the current chat session, and other available chat history.
- useAppChat: to get the current chat messages, and other available chat history.
- useChatUI: to get the current chat UI state
- useTabUi: to get the current chat tab state.
```

</CodeGroup>

Please manually check the `components/studio/` folder for further understanding.

### üó∫Ô∏è **Upcoming: Ai Studio Features**

AI Studio is being enhanced with powerful visualization tools:

#### **Agentic Map**

- **Visual Agent Architecture**: Interactive diagrams showing your agent hierarchy and relationships
- **Real-time Flow Tracking**: See how requests flow through your agent network
- **Performance Metrics**: Visual indicators of agent performance and bottlenecks

#### **Iteration**

- **A/B Testing**: Test different versions of your agents in parallel
- **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive error logging and debugging
- **Token Usage Logging** at each & every step of the agentic flow.

#### **Extensible Architecture**

- **Plugin System**: Add custom functionality through plugins
- **Custom Components**: Build and share custom React components
