description: 'Comparison between LangGraph and AI Router for multi-agent workflows.'
---

While LangGraph offers a solution for multi-agent workflows, it has significant limitations for full-stack applications:

1. **Python-heavy**: While langgraph.js exists, its not designed for typescript based framework
2. **Backend-focused**: Not designed for Next.js and modern web frameworks
3. **Complex setup**: Requires significant infrastructure changes
4. **No frontend integration**: Doesn't work seamlessly with Vercel AI SDK
5. **Learning curve**: Steep learning curve for web developers

### Features Comparison

AI Router is a more suitable solution for modern web applications compared to LangGraph, especially when working with TypeScript, Next.js, and the Vercel AI SDK.

| Feature                  | LangGraph              | AI Router                    |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Language**             | Python heavy           | TypeScript/JavaScript        |
| **Framework**            | Backend-focused        | Full-stack (Next.js first)   |
| **Learning Curve**       | Steep (new paradigm)   | Familiar (Express.js style)  |
| **Frontend Integration** | None                   | Native Vercel AI SDK support |
| **Deployment**           | Complex infrastructure | Simple Vercel deployment     |
| **Type Safety**          | Limited                | Full TypeScript support      |
| **Middleware**           | Custom implementation  | Express.js style middleware  |
| **State Management**     | Complex                | Simple shared state object   |
