## What are workers?

Workers run **background jobs** outside the request/response path. They are durable (state stored in MongoDB or Redis), scalable (run on AWS Lambda via SQS), and support chaining (worker-to-worker and multi-step queues).

## Key pieces

- **`@microfox/ai-worker`** – Runtime for defining workers (Zod input/output, handler, job store, dispatch).
- **`@microfox/ai-worker-cli`** – Scans worker and queue definitions, builds Lambda handlers, and deploys to AWS (Serverless Framework).
- **Application API** – HTTP routes to trigger workers, poll job status, and receive webhooks. You add these via the CLI boilerplate or your own routes.

## Flow in short

1. Your app (or a schedule) triggers a worker via the workers API or by calling `worker.dispatch()`.
2. The job is enqueued to SQS; Lambda runs the handler when a message is received.
3. The handler updates job status and output in the job store; optional webhook is called on completion.
4. Callers poll the workers API for status or rely on the webhook.

Workers can also call other workers (`ctx.dispatchWorker`) in fire-and-forget or await mode, and you can define **worker queues** (fixed sequences of workers) that run step-by-step with optional input mapping between steps.

## When to use workers

- Long-running or bursty tasks (data processing, reports, notifications).
- When you need durable state and progress (job store, polling, webhooks).
- Multi-step pipelines (queues) without writing orchestration code.
- Offloading work from the request path so the UI stays responsive.
