## Start a New Project

It is recommened to use the `kickstart` command to create a new AiRouter project with Next.js,
as it comes with in-built example of basic agents & orchestration.

```bash terminal
npx microfox@latest kickstart
cd <your-app>
npm run dev
```

This will create a new AiRouter project with Next.js, and a readily built UI for Ai Router testing, at http://localhost:3000/studio

## Manual Installation

To get started, install the `@microfox/ai-router` package using your preferred package manager:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm install @microfox/ai-router 
  ```

```bash yarn
yarn add @microfox/ai-router
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @microfox/ai-router
```

</CodeGroup>

### Next Steps

Now that the basic setup is done, lets dive deeper into the Agent Orchestration.
