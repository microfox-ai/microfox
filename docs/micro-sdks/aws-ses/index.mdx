## A Simplified SDK for Amazon SES

`@microfox/aws-ses` is a lightweight TypeScript SDK that provides a simplified, high-level interface for sending emails with Amazon Simple Email Service (SES). It's designed to make common email-sending tasks easier and more intuitive than using the official AWS SDK directly.

### What Problem Does It Solve?
While the official AWS SDK for JavaScript (v3) is powerful and comprehensive, its modular design can be verbose for common tasks. Sending a simple email requires importing multiple command and client objects and understanding a complex configuration structure.

This SDK streamlines the process by:
-   **Providing a Simple, Unified Client:** A single `createSESSdk` function gives you a client ready to send emails.
-   **Simplifying the API:** Methods like `sendEmail` and `sendBulkEmails` accept a single, intuitive options object.
-   **Handling Boilerplate:** The SDK manages the creation and execution of the underlying SES commands for you.
-   **Adding Type Safety:** Provides a clear, type-safe interface for all parameters and options.

### Who Is This For?
This package is ideal for any developer using Node.js who needs to integrate email functionality into their application via Amazon SES. Common use cases include:
-   Sending transactional emails (e.g., password resets, order confirmations).
-   Distributing marketing or notification emails to a list of users.
-   Building applications that need to send emails with complex HTML content and attachments.

### High-Level Architecture
The SDK acts as a developer-friendly wrapper around the official `@aws-sdk/client-sesv2`. It simplifies the interface without sacrificing the power and reliability of the underlying AWS infrastructure.
