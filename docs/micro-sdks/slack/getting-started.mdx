## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need:
-   **Node.js:** Version 16.x or later.
-   **A Slack Workspace:** You need a workspace where you have permission to install apps.
-   **A Slack Bot Token:** The following steps will guide you through creating one.

## 1. Create a Slack App

First, you need to create a Slack App to get your API credentials.

1.  Navigate to the [Slack API website](https://api.slack.com/apps) and click **"Create New App"**.
2.  Choose **"From scratch"**, give your app a name (e.g., "My Notifier Bot"), and select the workspace you want to install it in.
3.  After creating the app, you'll be on the app's settings page. Go to **"OAuth & Permissions"** in the sidebar.
4.  Scroll down to the **"Scopes"** section. Scopes define what your app is allowed to do. For our example, we need to add the following **Bot Token Scopes**:
    -   `chat:write`: To send messages.
    -   `reactions:write`: To add reactions to messages.
    -   `users:read.email`: To find users by their email address.
5.  Scroll back to the top and click **"Install App to Workspace"**. Authorize the app.
6.  You will now see a **"Bot User OAuth Token"** on the same page. It will start with `xoxb-`. Copy this token; this is what you will use to initialize the client.

## 2. Installation

Add the `@microfox/slack` package to your project:
<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @microfox/slack
```
```bash yarn
yarn add @microfox/slack
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm add @microfox/slack
```
</CodeGroup>

## 3. Your First Automation Script

Let's create a script that performs a common workflow:
1.  Initializes the Slack client.
2.  Finds a specific user by their email address.
3.  Sends a direct message to that user.
4.  Adds a reaction to the message it just sent.

Create a new file named `notify.ts` and add the following code. Remember to replace the placeholder values.

```typescript
import { MicrofoxSlackClient } from '@microfox/slack';

// Best practice: Store your token in an environment variable
const SLACK_BOT_TOKEN = process.env.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN || 'YOUR_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN';
// The email of the user you want to message
const USER_EMAIL = 'user@example.com'; 

// 1. Initialize the client
const client = new MicrofoxSlackClient({
  token: SLACK_BOT_TOKEN,
});

async function findAndNotifyUser() {
  try {
    console.log(`Looking for user: ${USER_EMAIL}`);
    // 2. Find the user by email
    const userResponse = await client.users.lookupByEmail({
      email: USER_EMAIL,
    });

    if (!userResponse.ok || !userResponse.user) {
      throw new Error(`Could not find user: ${userResponse.error}`);
    }
    
    const userId = userResponse.user.id;
    console.log(`Found user ID: ${userId}`);

    // 3. Send a direct message to the user
    console.log('Sending message...');
    const messageResponse = await client.chat.postMessage({
      channel: userId, // Use the user's ID to send a DM
      text: 'Hello! This is an automated notification from our new bot. :wave:',
    });

    if (!messageResponse.ok || !messageResponse.ts || !messageResponse.channel) {
      throw new Error(`Could not send message: ${messageResponse.error}`);
    }
    
    console.log('Message sent successfully.');
    
    // 4. Add a reaction to the message
    console.log('Adding reaction...');
    await client.reactions.add({
      channel: messageResponse.channel, // Channel where the message was sent
      timestamp: messageResponse.ts,    // Timestamp of the message
      name: 'robot_face',               // The emoji to react with
    });

    console.log('Reaction added! Automation complete.');

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('An error occurred:', error.message);
  }
}

findAndNotifyUser();
```

### Running the Script
Set your environment variable and run the script using `ts-node`:

```bash
export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN="xoxb-YOUR-TOKEN-HERE"
ts-node notify.ts
```

Check Slack! The user you specified should have received a direct message with a :robot_face: reaction from your bot.
