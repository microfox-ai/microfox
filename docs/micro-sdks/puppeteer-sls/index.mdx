## Serverless Browser Automation Made Easy

`@microfox/puppeteer-sls` is a robust package that simplifies running Puppeteer in serverless environments. It provides a high-level API for common browser automation tasks, allowing you to build scalable, cost-effective web scraping and automation solutions without the hassle of managing servers.

### What Problem Does It Solve?

Running a full-fledged browser automation tool like Puppeteer in a resource-constrained serverless environment (like AWS Lambda) is notoriously difficult. Developers often face challenges with:

- **Large Package Sizes:** A standard Chromium installation is too large for serverless function deployment limits.
- **System Dependencies:** Serverless runtimes lack the necessary system libraries and fonts required by Chromium to render pages correctly.
- **Slow Cold Starts:** The time it takes to initialize a browser instance can lead to slow response times and increased costs.
- **Complex Configuration:** A significant amount of boilerplate code is required to get Puppeteer running smoothly in a serverless context.

`@microfox/puppeteer-sls` abstracts all these complexities away, providing a zero-configuration, plug-and-play solution.

### Who Is This For?

This package is ideal for developers who want to:

-   Build scalable web scrapers that can run on demand.
-   Generate PDFs or screenshots of web pages dynamically.
-   Automate interactions with websites as part of a larger workflow.
-   Run browser-based tests in a serverless CI/CD pipeline.
-   Leverage the power of a real browser without managing server infrastructure.

### Key Features

- **Zero-Configuration Setup:** Designed for a seamless experience in serverless environments like AWS Lambda.
- **Optimized for Performance:** Uses a compressed Chromium binary for fast cold starts and efficient resource usage.
- **High-Level API:** Offers a simple, intuitive API for common tasks like data extraction, screenshots, and more.
- **Flexible Usage:** Can be used as a comprehensive `PuppeteerSLS` object or as individual, tree-shakable functions.
- **Dependency-Free:** Includes all necessary system libraries and fonts, so you don't have to worry about them.
