## The Microfox Vision

Microfox is a revolutionary platform designed to decentralize and distribute AI agents and code. We believe software should not be a moat in the coming world - it's time to stop treating it as such. As software becomes increasingly cheaper and more accessible, traditional SaaS models will naturally evolve.

Our mission is to empower developers to build, distribute, and monetize AI agents through a decentralized ecosystem where code is modular, efficient, and accessible to all.
