## What is Microfox

Microfox aims to help developers build, deploy & distrubte real-world agents that are autonomous, scalable, and accessible to all.

## The Microfox Vision

The core vision of Microfox is to create a comprehensive, standardized framework for AI agent development, much like Next.js did for web development.

The current landscape for building AI agents is fragmented and chaotic, plagued by challenges in agent-to-agent communication (A2A), authentication, security, and a general lack of standard protocols.

This complexity has limited most "AI agents" to being little more than advanced chatbots, failing to unlock their true potential.
Microfox aims to solve this by providing developers with the tools to build, deploy, and distribute powerful, secure AI agents that can seamlessly and safely interact with each other & access user data from any source with user's scoped permissions.

## Core Concepts

We are heavily oriented towards typescipt based frameworks and our vision is built on several key pillars:

### AI Router (v2 out now)

Recognizing the limitations of existing tools, Microfox built its own orchestration engine as a more powerful and developer-friendly alternative to LangGraph, specifically tailored for the full-stack TypeScript community.

### Micro SDKs

These are practical, AI-augmentive SDKs that allow developers to easily and securely access user data from various platforms (like Google, Slack, etc.) or other Ai helper libraries.

They are the plug-in-play tools that make agent development faster and more robust within any typescript based framework.

### The X Framework (Alpha)

This is the central framework designed to make the entire agent development lifecycle—from building to deployment and distribution—radically simpler.

A key goal is to make the framework "semi-autonomous," embedding coding agents directly into the development process. This means developers won't have to read extensive documentation to get started; the framework itself will help them set things up, accelerating development.

### The Code Loop & "Code that Writes Code"

Similar to the "Darwin's Godel Machine" concept introduced by Sakana, Microfox is heavily investing in building agents that can write and improve their own code.

The "Code Loop" is the internal project dedicated to creating these coding agents. This meta-level development is fundamental to their strategy, as these agents are already responsible for writing and maintaining a significant portion (around 70%) of their own infrastructure, with human developers acting as reviewers.

# The Future

### Ultimately, Microfox envisions a future where building and distributing an AI agent is as straightforward as building and deploying a website today.

These agents will be served through standard protocols (like A2A, MCP, and a proposed OpenAPI specification) and will plug into a user's "host assistant," creating a vibrant and interconnected ecosystem of specialized AI assistants.
