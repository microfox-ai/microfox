To connect Fillout to your app, you’ll first start by creating an OAuth application in Fillout, which can later be submit for approval to be listed publicly for Fillout users.\n \nCreating an OAuth app\nFirst, head to your account settings, and click on Developer settings, and select OAuth integrations\n \nEnter a name for your application (this is what users will see when they connect to your app), and click Create app.\n \nConfigure your application\nYou’ll want to select an icon for your app (users will see this when they first connect), and also set up some basic properties:\n \n \nRedirect URI: these are the endpoints you’d like to get sent to during the OAuth token exchange process to receive the token (more info below)\nClient secret: you should generate a client secret to get started. Make sure to save this token, it will only be shown once.\nClient id: this is the public ID of your application.\n \nOAuth process\nAuthorization request\nGET https://build.fillout.com/authorize/oauth\n \nTo initiate the OAuth process, you’ll start by sending users to the above endpoint, with the following query parameters:\nclient_id: the client ID of your app, which you can find while configuring it (see above)\nredirect_uri: the URL you expect to be redirected to, once access is granted for the token\nstate: any string you’d like to use to retain state when redirecting back to your app\n \nAfter authorization, the user’s browser will be redirected back to the redirect URI passed. Successful requests will forward the following query parameters to that URI:\ncode: a unique oauth authorization code you can use to exchange for an access token\nstate: the state parameter you passed in initially\n \nToken creation request\nPOST https://server.fillout.com/public/oauth/accessToken\n \nCall this endpoint once you’ve successfully been redirected to after the authorization request. Pass, in the body of the request:\ncode: the code you received in the previous step\nclient_id: your client id for your app\nclient_secret: the client secret you generated for your app\nredirect_uri: the redirect uri you originally received to generate this code.\n \nA successful response will look like:\n{\n\t\"access_token\": \"abcdefg\",\n\t\"base_url\": \"https://api.fillout.com\",\n}\n \nThe access_token will grant access to the Fillout API\nThe base_url is the base URL for the api. Usually, this will be https://api.fillout.com, but may vary if you are in different geo-locations, or are self-hosting.\n \nInvalidate access token\nDELETE https://server.fillout.com/public/oauth/invalidate\n \nTo authenticate this request, pass the following headers:\n{\n\t\"Authentication\": \"Bearer <your-api-key>\"\n}\n \n \nPREVIOUS\n← HTML and CSS form field\nThe all-in-one form solution\nlinkedin-icon\nx-icon\naicpa-soc-icon\nGENERAL\nHome\nPricing\nIntegrations\nCareers\nReport abuse\nWhat's new\nBlog\nEnterprise\nPRODUCT\nForms\nScheduling\nPDF generation\nPayments\nWorkflows\nConversion kit\nZite\nAI TOOLS\nAI Quiz Maker\nAI Form Builder\nAI Survey Maker\nImport Google Form\nAI Signature Maker\nSurvey questions\nPDF to Form\nRESOURCES\nHelp Center\nAbout Fillout\nStatus\nForm builder comparison\nFillout vs Jotform\nvs Typeform\nvs Google Forms\nvs Formstack\nSOC II Type 2\n256-bit AES\n24/5 Tech support\nPress kitPrivacyTerms© 2025 Restly, Inc.",
