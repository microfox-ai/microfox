## Function: `lipSync`

Submits a task to synchronize the lip movements of a person in a video with a new audio track. This is useful for dubbing, creating talking avatars, or correcting audio-video mismatches.

**Note:** The specific parameters for the request body (`LipSyncRequestBody`) are not defined in the current version of the SDK's type definitions. Please refer to the official Klingai API documentation for the detailed structure of the request body.

**Purpose:**
To start a lip-syncing job that modifies a video to match a given audio file.

**Parameters:**

- `params` (object, required): An object containing the parameters for the lip-sync task. This corresponds to the `LipSyncRequestBody` type.
  - **(undefined)**: The properties for this object are not yet specified in the SDK. You should structure this object according to the official Klingai API documentation, likely including URLs to the source video and audio files.

**Return Value:**

- `Promise<TaskResponse>`: A promise that resolves to a generic task response object.
  - `code` (number): The status code of the response.
  - `message` (string): A message describing the result of the request.
  - `request_id` (string): The unique ID for this API request.
  - `data` (object): An object containing task-specific information.
    - `task_id` (string): The unique identifier for the newly created task.
    - `task_status` (string): The initial status of the task (e.g., `'submitted'`).

**Examples:**

```typescript
// Example 1: Submitting a lip-sync task
// Note: The structure of the 'params' object depends on the official API documentation.
// The example below uses an empty object as a placeholder.

try {
  const response = await klingai.lipSync({
    // Add required parameters like 'video_url' and 'audio_url' as per the API docs.
    // e.g., videoUrl: 'https://example.com/video.mp4', audioUrl: 'https://example.com/audio.mp3'
  });
  console.log('Lip-sync task submitted:', response);
  // You can use response.data.task_id to query the task status later.
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error submitting lip-sync task:', error);
}
