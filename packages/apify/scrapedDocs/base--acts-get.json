The response is a list of objects, where each object contains a basic information about a single Actor.\n\nTo only get Actors created by the user, add the my=1 query parameter.\n\nThe endpoint supports pagination using the limit and offset parameters and it will not return more than 1000 records.\n\nBy default, the records are sorted by the createdAt field in ascending order, therefore you can use pagination to incrementally fetch all Actors while new ones are still being created. To sort the records in descending order, use the desc=1 parameter.\n\nYou can also sort by lastRunStartedAt by using the sortBy=lastRunStartedAt query parameter. In this case, descending order means the most recently run Actor appears first.\n\nRequest​\nQUERY PARAMETERS\nmy\nboolean\n\nIf true or 1 then the returned list only contains Actors owned by the user. The default value is false.\n\noffset\ndouble\n\nNumber of records that should be skipped at the start. The default value is 0.\n\nlimit\ndouble\n\nMaximum number of records to return. The default value as well as the maximum is 1000.\n\ndesc\nboolean\n\nIf true or 1 then the objects are sorted by the createdAt field in descending order. By default, they are sorted in ascending order.\n\nsortBy\nstring\n\nPossible values: [createdAt, lastRunStartedAt]\n\nField to sort the records by. The default is createdAt. You can also use lastRunStartedAt to sort by the most recently ran Actors.\n\nResponses​\n200\nResponse Headers\nAPPLICATION/JSON\nSchema\nExample (auto)\nExample\nSCHEMA\ndata\nobject\nAUTHORIZATION: HTTP\nCLI\nJavaScript\nPython\nPHP\nJava\nC\nC#\nGo\nRust\nNode.js\nRuby\nPowerShell\nDart\nObjective-C\nOCaml\nR\nSwift\nKotlin\nApify CLI\n\tapify actors ls\n\nCURL\n\tcurl -L 'https://api.apify.com/v2/acts' \\\n\n\t-H 'Accept: application/json' \\\n\n\t-H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'\n\nREQUEST\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nBase URL\nhttps://api.apify.com\nAuth\nSecurity Scheme\nhttpBearer\napiKey\nBearer Token\nParameters\nShow optional parameters\nSEND API REQUEST\nRESPONSE\nCLEAR\n\nClick the Send API Request button above and see the response here!\n\nLEARN\nAcademy\nPlatform\nAPI\nReference\nClient for JavaScript\nClient for Python\nSDK\nSDK for JavaScript\nSDK for Python\nOTHER\nCLI\nOpen source\nMORE\nCrawlee\nGitHub\nTrust Center",
