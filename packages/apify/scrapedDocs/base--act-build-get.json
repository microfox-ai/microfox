Gets an object that contains all the details about a specific build of an Actor.\n\nBy passing the optional waitForFinish parameter the API endpoint will synchronously wait for the build to finish. This is useful to avoid periodic polling when waiting for an Actor build to finish.\n\nThis endpoint does not require the authentication token. Instead, calls are authenticated using a hard-to-guess ID of the build. However, if you access the endpoint without the token, certain attributes, such as usageUsd and usageTotalUsd, will be hidden.\n\nRequest​\nPATH PARAMETERS\nactorId\nstring\nREQUIRED\n\nActor ID or a tilde-separated owner's username and Actor name.\n\nbuildId\nstring\nREQUIRED\n\nID of the build you want to get, found in the build's Info tab.\n\nQUERY PARAMETERS\nwaitForFinish\ndouble\n\nThe maximum number of seconds the server waits for the build to finish. By default it is 0, the maximum value is 60. If the build finishes in time then the returned build object will have a terminal status (e.g. SUCCEEDED), otherwise it will have a transitional status (e.g. RUNNING).\n\nResponses​\n200\nResponse Headers\nAPPLICATION/JSON\nSchema\nExample (auto)\nExample\nSCHEMA\ndata\nobject\nAUTHORIZATION: TOKEN\nCLI\nJavaScript\nPython\nPHP\nJava\nC\nC#\nGo\nRust\nNode.js\nRuby\nPowerShell\nDart\nObjective-C\nOCaml\nR\nSwift\nKotlin\nCURL\n\tcurl -L 'https://api.apify.com/v2/acts/:actorId/builds/:buildId' \\\n\n\t-H 'Accept: application/json'\n\nREQUEST\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nBase URL\nhttps://api.apify.com\nAuth\nSecurity Scheme\napiKeyActorBuilds\nhttpBearerActorBuilds\napiKeyActorBuilds\nParameters\nactorId — pathREQUIRED\nbuildId — pathREQUIRED\nShow optional parameters\nSEND API REQUEST\nRESPONSE\nCLEAR\n\nClick the Send API Request button above and see the response here!\n\nLEARN\nAcademy\nPlatform\nAPI\nReference\nClient for JavaScript\nClient for Python\nSDK\nSDK for JavaScript\nSDK for Python\nOTHER\nCLI\nOpen source\nMORE\nCrawlee\nGitHub\nTrust Center",
