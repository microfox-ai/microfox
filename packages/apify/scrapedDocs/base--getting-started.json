The API is organized around RESTful HTTP endpoints.\n\nHTTP Client\n\nApify API\n\nActor Run\n\nDataset\n\nKey-Value Store\n\nThe diagram illustrates the basic workflow when using the Apify API:\n\nYour application communicates with the Apify API by sending requests to run Actors and receiving results back.\nWhen you request to run an Actor, the Apify API creates and manages an Actor run instance on the platform.\nThe Actor processes data and stores results in Apify's storage systems:\nDataset: Structured storage optimized for tabular or list-type data, ideal for scraped items or processed results.\nKey-Value Store: Flexible storage for various data types (including images, JSON, HTML, and text), perfect for configuration settings and non-tabular outputs.\nPrerequisites​\n\nBefore you can start using the API, check if you have all the necessary prerequisites:\n\nAn Apify account with an API token.\nA tool to make HTTP requests (cURL, Postman, or your preferred programming language).\nAuthentication​\n\nYou must authenticate all API requests presented on this page. You can authenticate using your API token:\n\nAuthorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN\n\n\nYou can find your API token in the Apify Console under Settings > Integrations.\n\nVerify your account​\n\nTo check your API credentials or account details:\n\nEndpoint\nGET https://api.apify.com/v2/users/me\n\n\nExpected response codes:\n\n200\nBasic workflow​\n\nThe most common workflow involving Apify API consists of the following steps:\n\nRunning an Actor.\nRetrieving the results.\n1. Run an Actor​\nSynchronously​\n\nFor shorter runs where you need immediate results:\n\nEndpoint\nPOST https://api.apify.com/v2/acts/:actorId/run-sync\n\n\nExpected response codes:\n\n201\n400\n408\nAsynchronously​\n\nFor longer-running operations or when you don't need immediate results.\n\nEndpoint\nPOST https://api.apify.com/v2/acts/:actorId/runs\n\n\nExpected response codes:\n\n201\n2. Retrieve results​\nFrom a Dataset​\n\nMost Actors store their results in a dataset:\n\nEndpoint\nGET https://api.apify.com/v2/datasets/:datasetId/items\n\n\nOptional query parameters:\n\nformat=json (default), other possible formats are:\njsonl\nxml\nhtml\ncsv\nxlsx\nrss\nlimit=100 (number of items to retrieve)\noffset=0 (pagination offset)\n\nExpected response codes:\n\n200\nFrom a Key-value store​\nEndpoint\nGET https://api.apify.com/v2/key-value-stores/:storeId/records/:recordKey\n\n\nExpected response codes:\n\n200\n302\nAdditional operations​\nGet log​\n\nYou can get a log for a specific run or build of an Actor.\n\nEndpoint\nGET https://api.apify.com/v2/logs/:buildOrRunId\n\n\nExpected response codes:\n\n200\nMonitor run status​\nEndpoint\nGET https://api.apify.com/v2/actor-runs/:runId\n\n\nExpected response codes:\n\n200\nStore data in Dataset​\n\nTo store your own data in a Dataset:\n\nEndpoint\nPOST https://api.apify.com/v2/datasets/:datasetId/items\n\n\nIf any item in the request fails validation, the entire request will be rejected.\n\nExpected response codes:\n\n201\n400\nStore data in Key-value store​\n\nTo store your own data in a Key-value store:\n\nEndpoint\nPUT https://api.apify.com/v2/key-value-stores/:storeId/records/:recordKey\n\n\nInclude your data in the request body and set the appropriate Content-Type header.\n\nExpected response codes:\n\n201\nHTTP Status Code Descriptions​\n200 OK​\n\nThe request has succeeded.\n\n201 Created​\n\nThe request has been fulfilled and a new resource has been created.\n\n302 Found​\n\nA redirection response indicating that the requested resource has been temporarily moved to a different URL.\n\n400 Bad Request​\n\nThe server cannot process the request due to client error, such as request syntax, invalid request parameters, or invalid data format. This occurs when:\n\nThe request body contains invalid data\nRequired parameters are missing\nData validation fails for Dataset items\n408 Request Timeout​\n\nThe server timed out waiting for the request to complete.\n\nNext steps​\nExplore more advanced API endpoints in our full API reference.\nLearn about webhooks to get notified when your runs finish.\nCheck out Apify client libraries for the following programming languages:\nJavaScript\nPython\nPrevious\nIntroduction\nNext\nActors - Introduction\nLEARN\nAcademy\nPlatform\nAPI\nReference\nClient for JavaScript\nClient for Python\nSDK\nSDK for JavaScript\nSDK for Python\nOTHER\nCLI\nOpen source\nMORE\nCrawlee\nGitHub\nTrust Center",
