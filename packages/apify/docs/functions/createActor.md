This function is used to programmatically create new actors. You need to provide the necessary details for the actor, such as its name and other configuration.

  - `createdAt` (string): Date when the actor was created.
  - `modifiedAt` (string): Date when the actor was last modified.
  - ... and other fields as defined in the `Actor` type.

**Return Value:**
- `Promise<Actor>`: A promise that resolves to the newly created `Actor` object, including its server-assigned `id`.
- `Actor` (object):
  - `id` (string): Unique identifier of the actor.
  - `name` (string): Name of the actor.
  - `username` (string): Username of the actor's owner.
  - `createdAt` (string): ISO 8601 date string of when the actor was created.
  - `modifiedAt` (string): ISO 8601 date string of when the actor was last modified.

```typescript
// Example 1: Create a new actor with required fields
const newActorData = {
  name: 'my-new-actor',
  username: '<your_username>',
  createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  modifiedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  // Add other required fields from the Actor type
};
const createdActor = await apify.createActor(newActorData);
