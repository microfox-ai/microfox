Copy the API key and keep it secure.\n\nTo use the SDK, you can either pass the API key directly to the SDK constructor or set it as an environment variable:\n\n- Environment variable name: SUNO_API_KEY\n\nExample usage:\n\n```typescript\nimport { createSunoSDK } from '@microfox/suno';\n\n// Using environment variable\nconst sunoSDK = createSunoSDK();\n\n// Or passing the API key directly\nconst sunoSDK = createSunoSDK({ apiKey: 'your-api-key-here' });\n```\n\nMake sure to keep your API key secure and never share it publicly. If you suspect your API key has been compromised, reset it immediately through the Suno API Key Management Page.\n\nThe SDK uses the Fetch API, which is available in Node.js environments version 18 and above. If you're using an older version of Node.js, you may need to use a polyfill for Fetch."
