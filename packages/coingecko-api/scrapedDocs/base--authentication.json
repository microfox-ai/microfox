Using query string parameters can risk exposing your API key.\n\n\nCoinGecko API Authentication Method\n\nIf this is your first time using the Pro API key, you can supply API Key to the root URL using one of these ways:\n\nHeader (Recommended): x-cg-pro-api-key\nQuery String Parameter: x_cg_pro_api_key\nAuthentication Method\tExample using Ping Endpoint\nHeader (cURL)\tcurl -X GET \"https://pro-api.coingecko.com/api/v3/ping\" -H \"x-cg-pro-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY\"\nQuery String Parameter\thttps://pro-api.coingecko.com/api/v3/ping?x_cg_pro_api_key=YOUR_API_KEY\n\n\nüî• Accessing On-Chain DEX data (Beta)\n\nYou can now use the Pro-API key (exclusive to any paid plan subscriber) to call on-chain DEX data powered by GeckoTerminal.\n\nüìò\n\nNotes\n\nAuthentication method for on-chain endpoints is exactly same as other endpoints.\nWhen using the CG Pro API to access on-chain DEX data, include the /onchain endpoint path in the request.\nAuthentication Method\tExample using Simple Token Price Endpoint\nHeader (cURL)\tcurl -X GET \"<https://pro-api.coingecko.com/api/v3/onchain/simple/networks/eth/token_price/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2>\" -H \"x-cg-pro-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY\"\nQuery String Parameter\thttps://pro-api.coingecko.com/api/v3/onchain/simple/networks/eth/token_price/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2?x_cg_pro_api_key=YOUR_API_KEY\n\n\nAPI Key Usage Credits\nEach request made to any endpoint counts as a single call (1 call = 1 credit).\nYour monthly credit & rate limit are determined by the paid plan to which you subscribe.
