The API exposes most of the features available in the Google Calendar Web interface.\n\nFollowing is a list of common terms used in the Google Calendar API:\n\nEvent\nAn event on a calendar containing information such as the title, start and end times, and attendees. Events can be either single events or recurring events. An event is represented by an Event resource.\nCalendar\nA collection of events. Each calendar has associated metadata, such as calendar description or default calendar time zone. The metadata for a single calendar is represented by a Calendar resource.\nCalendar List\nA list of all calendars on a user's calendar list in the Calendar UI. The metadata for a single calendar that appears on the calendar list is represented by a CalendarListEntry resource. This metadata includes user-specific properties of the calendar, such as its color or notifications for new events.\nSetting\nA user preference from the Calendar UI, such as the user's time zone. A single user preference is represented by a Setting Resource.\nACL\nAn access control rule granting a user (or a group of users) a specified level of access to a calendar. A single access control rule is represented by an ACL resource.\nRelated topics\n\nTo learn about developing with Google Workspace APIs, including handling authentication and authorization, refer to Get started as a Google Workspace developer.\n\nTo learn how to configure and run a simple Google Calendar API app, read the Quickstarts overview.\n\n\t\nWant to see the Google Calendar API in action?\nThe Google Workspace Developers channel offers videos about tips, tricks, and the latest features.\nSubscribe now\nWas this helpful?\nSend feedback\n\nExcept as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License, and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.
