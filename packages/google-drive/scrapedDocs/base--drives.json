The set of possible driveThemes can be retrieved from a drive.about.get response. When not specified on a drive.drives.create request, a random theme is chosen from which the background image and color are set. This is a write-only field; it can only be set on requests that don't set colorRgb or backgroundImageFile.\n\nbackgroundImageFile\n\nobject\n\nAn image file and cropping parameters from which a background image for this shared drive is set.

The time at which the shared drive was created (RFC 3339 date-time).\n\nhidden\n\nboolean\n\nWhether the shared drive is hidden from default view.\n\nrestrictions\n\nobject\n\nA set of restrictions that apply to this shared drive or items inside this shared drive. Note that restrictions can't be set when creating a shared drive. To add a restriction, first create a shared drive and then use drives.update to add restrictions.\n\nrestrictions.copyRequiresWriterPermission\n\nboolean\n\nWhether the options to copy, print, or download files inside this shared drive, should be disabled for readers and commenters. When this restriction is set to true, it will override the similarly named field to true for any file inside this shared drive.\n\nrestrictions.domainUsersOnly\n\nboolean\n\nWhether access to this shared drive and items inside this shared drive is restricted to users of the domain to which this shared drive belongs.

If false, users with either the organizer role or the file organizer role can share folders.\n\norgUnitId\n\nstring\n\nOutput only. The organizational unit of this shared drive. This field is only populated on drives.list responses when the useDomainAdminAccess parameter is set to true.\n\nMethods\ncreate\nCreates a shared drive.\ndelete\nPermanently deletes a shared drive for which the user is an organizer.\nget\nGets a shared drive's metadata by ID.\nhide\nHides a shared drive from the default view.\nlist\n\nLists the user's shared drives.\n\nunhide\nRestores a shared drive to the default view.\nupdate\nUpdates the metadata for a shared drive.\nWas this helpful?\nSend feedback\n\nExcept as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License, and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.
