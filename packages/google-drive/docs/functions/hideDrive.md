## Function: `hideDrive`

Hides a shared drive from the user's view. This operation does not delete the drive or alter its permissions; it merely removes the drive from the default list of drives displayed to the user. This can be useful for users to declutter their list of shared drives by hiding those they do not access frequently.

**Purpose:**
To allow users to selectively hide shared drives from their main drive list, improving organization and focus on relevant drives.

**Parameters:**
- `driveId`: `string` (required)
  - The unique identifier (ID) of the shared drive that needs to be hidden. This ID can be obtained by listing drives or from other API responses.

**Return Value:**
- `Promise<void>`
  - A promise that resolves when the shared drive has been successfully hidden.
  - It throws an error if the operation fails, for instance, if the `driveId` is invalid, the drive does not exist, or the user lacks the necessary permissions to hide the drive.

**Examples:**
```typescript
// Example 1: Hide a specific shared drive
async function hideSpecificDrive(sdk: GoogleDriveSdk, driveIdToHide: string) {
  try {
    await sdk.hideDrive(driveIdToHide);
    console.log(`Drive ${driveIdToHide} has been hidden successfully.`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Failed to hide drive ${driveIdToHide}:`, error);
    // Implement error handling, e.g., notify the user
  }
}

// Assuming 'sdk' is an initialized instance of GoogleDriveSdk
// and 'specificDriveId' is the ID of the drive to hide.
// hideSpecificDrive(sdk, '<specificDriveId>');
```
