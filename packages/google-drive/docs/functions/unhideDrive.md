## Function: `unhideDrive`

Makes a previously hidden shared drive visible to the user again. This operation reverses the effect of `hideDrive`. If the drive was not hidden, this operation has no effect.

**Purpose:**
To allow users to restore visibility of shared drives they had previously hidden, making them appear again in their default list of drives.

**Parameters:**
- `driveId`: `string` (required)
  - The unique identifier (ID) of the shared drive that needs to be unhidden. This ID can be obtained by listing drives (if it was hidden, it might require special parameters to list hidden drives or knowledge of the ID from another source) or from other API responses.

**Return Value:**
- `Promise<void>`
  - A promise that resolves when the shared drive has been successfully unhidden.
  - It throws an error if the operation fails, for instance, if the `driveId` is invalid, the drive does not exist, or the user lacks the necessary permissions to unhide the drive.

**Examples:**
```typescript
// Example 1: Unhide a specific shared drive
async function unhideSpecificDrive(sdk: GoogleDriveSdk, driveIdToUnhide: string) {
  try {
    await sdk.unhideDrive(driveIdToUnhide);
    console.log(`Drive ${driveIdToUnhide} has been unhidden successfully.`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Failed to unhide drive ${driveIdToUnhide}:`, error);
    // Implement error handling, e.g., notify the user
  }
}

// Assuming 'sdk' is an initialized instance of GoogleDriveSdk
// and 'specificDriveId' is the ID of the drive to unhide.
// unhideSpecificDrive(sdk, '<specificDriveId>');
```
